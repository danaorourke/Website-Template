I am just a simple website template.

I have a header, section (with an id of content), and a footer. I have no bells and whistles, just some dummy lorem ipsum.

Enjoy me. Mold me. Change me. Fill me with your custom content and CSS. That's what I'm here for; a springboard to jump from when other templates are too large.
